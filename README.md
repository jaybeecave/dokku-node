# dokku-node

dokku-node is a plugin for [dokku][dokku] that injects node with the listed packages within your dokku environment.
This is mostly useful for instances where you have a say a python buildpack but you want to have less or coffeescript
available to compile files.

## Installation

On your dokku server:
```sh
# On 0.3.x
git clone https://github.com/jaybeecave/dokku-node.git /var/lib/dokku/plugins/dokku-node
dokku plugins-install
sh

# On 0.4.x
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/jaybeecave/dokku-node.git dokku-node
```

All future deployments will use have node with the packages in the `pacakges` file installed by npm.
